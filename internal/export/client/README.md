# EdgeX Foundry Export Client Service
[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%20v2.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Export Client Registration micro service - allows clients to register for data from EdgeX (via MQTT, REST, Azure IoT Hub, Google IoT Core, and other connectors today) and specify compression, encryption, format (JSON, XML), and destination of data.  Export Client dictates how and where Export Distro sends EdgeX data.

# Install and Deploy Native #

### Prerequisites ###
Serveral EdgeX Foundry services depend on ZeroMQ for communications by default.  The easiest way to get and install ZeroMQ is to use or follow the following setup script:  https://gist.github.com/katopz/8b766a5cb0ca96c816658e9407e83d00.

**Note**: Setup of the ZeroMQ library is not supported on Windows plaforms.

### Installation and Execution ###
To fetch the code and build the microservice execute the following:

```
cd $GOPATH/src
go get github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go
# pull the 3rd party / vendor packages
make prepare
# build the microservice
make cmd/export-client/export-client
# get to the export client microservice executable
cd cmd/export-client
# run the microservice (may require other dependent services to run correctly)
./export-client
```
