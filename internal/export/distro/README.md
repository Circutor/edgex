Export Distribution Microservice receives data from core data (via Q) and then filters, transforms, formats the data per client request and finally distributes it via REST, MQTT or 0MQ. Built on the concept of EAI or pipe and filter archtitecture.

# Install and Deploy Native #

### Prerequisites ###
Serveral EdgeX Foundry services depend on ZeroMQ for communications by default.  The easiest way to get and install ZeroMQ is to use or follow the following setup script:  https://gist.github.com/katopz/8b766a5cb0ca96c816658e9407e83d00.

**Note**: Setup of the ZeroMQ library is not supported on Windows plaforms.

### Installation and Execution ###
To fetch the code and build the microservice execute the following:

```
cd $GOPATH/src
go get github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go
# pull the 3rd party / vendor packages
make prepare
# build the microservice
make cmd/export-distro/export-distro
# get to the export distro microservice executable
cd cmd/export-distro
# run the microservice (may require other dependent services to run correctly)
./export-distro
```
