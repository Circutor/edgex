**Note**: Setup of the ZeroMQ library is not supported on Windows plaforms.

### Installation and Execution ###

```
cd $GOPATH/src
go get github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go
# pull the 3rd party / vendor packages
make prepare
# build the microservice
make cmd/support-logging/support-logging
# get to the support logging microservice executable
cd cmd/support-logging
# run the microservice (may require other dependent services to run correctly)
